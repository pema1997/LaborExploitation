    <h1 style="text-align: center;">What is wrong with the system?
    </h1>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        Should we blame our economic system? 
        or is it just the human greed to<br> take advantage of the inferior? Why are <br>labours still underpaid in 21st century?
        <br>Especially, what does it takes for a loyal worker to be true loyal to their<br> employer? <br>Is the labour exploitation justifiable? </p>
    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Where did it start?</h2>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> The unethical treatment of labor dates back to 1500s <br>during the medieval period when poor peasants were forced to work under their employers, also known as lord back in the medieval age,the government<br> also made sure that the peasants gets no say in their work or rebel against their treatment by their employers. "Masters and Servents act" also required<br> to labors to work under their employers for a long period of time, surviving on a very low pay. Gradually, Capitalism took in chanrge of the economic<br> system resuliting in large numbers of unethically treated workers.This process of industrilization exploited workers in a way that would be intolerable<br> today. The greedy employers hired cheap labors such as children and women. </p>
    
    <h3 style="text-align: center;"> Emergence of labor union</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;"> If it wasn't for the people who fought for fair wage, <br>ethical treatment of labors then we would have been sitll living under the greed of Capitalist's employers. The emergence of labor union dates back<br> to 18th century during the industrial revolution.The unions were initiated by artisans late in the colonial period.The first strike against the reduced<br> wage took place in New York in 1768 by Journeyman Tailors.These stirkes eventually led to the formation of "Federal Society of Journeymen <br>Cordwainers in 1794.This marks as the beginning of trade union among American workers. Craft unions demaded for fair-wage and rebeled against cheap <br>labors and labors exploitation. Craftmen formed unions such as "The Mechanics' Union of Trade Assiosiation" in 1827 and "International Typographical<br> union in 1852." National and state union began to work together from all across The United States and Canada. However, these unions were focused and <br>led by skilled workers and the workers in lower sector played little role during the period. </p>
